# Where Do They Stand?

Access to Safe Legal Abortion is a Human Right. This is codified by the United Nations in the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights via General Comment No. 36 point 8 (2019).

150 Republican House Members have co-sponsored the Life At Conception Act of 2021 (HR 1011), which would revoke that right in US law, banning the right to Abortion nationwide, without exceptions.

These are the PACs that have contributed money for the 2021-2022 election cycle for those candidates, ordered by the amount donated, as recorded by OpenSecrets.org.
