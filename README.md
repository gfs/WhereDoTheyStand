# Where Do They Stand?

Access to Safe Legal Abortion is a Human Right. This is codified by the United Nations in the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights via General Comment No. 36 point 8 (2019).

150 Republican House Members have co-sponsored the Life At Conception Act of 2021 (HR 1011), which would revoke that right in US law, revoking the right to Abortion nationwide.
